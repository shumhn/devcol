# c0Foundr

**Find your co-founder. Build together. Own your profile.**

No apps to install. No sign-ups. No passwords. Just your wallet and the people you want to build with.

## What is it?

c0Foundr is like LinkedIn for Web3 developers, but you actually own your profile.

Your profile is a token that lives in your wallet (like Phantom). Your projects are public on the blockchain. Anyone can verify who's working with who.

Think "Create Profile → Post Project → Get Applications → Build Together" — but simpler, fairer, and yours to keep.

## Why it's cool

**Your profile belongs to you**: it's in your wallet, not hidden in a company server.

**No surprise shutdowns**: if c0Foundr disappears tomorrow, your profile and projects stay on the blockchain forever.

**Transparent by default**: every action (create profile, send request, accept teammate) has a public receipt.

**Works across the ecosystem**: one wallet works everywhere in Web3—no separate accounts.

**Fast and simple**: actions feel like tapping a button; blockchain confirmations are quick on Solana.

**Upload once, keep forever**: your profile picture and project logos go to IPFS—they'll never disappear.

## Who is it for?

**Solo developers** looking for teammates to build their idea.

**Project owners** who need frontend devs, smart contract builders, or designers.

**Web3 newbies** who want to find mentors and learn by building real projects.

**Hackathon teams** that want to form groups and track contributions transparently.

## How it works (real life)

### Developer (looking for teams)

1. Open c0Foundr, connect your Phantom wallet (takes 3 seconds)
2. Fill out your profile: name, skills, GitHub, Twitter—done
3. Upload a profile pic (it goes to IPFS, stored forever)
4. Browse projects that need help
5. See one you like? Click "Request to Join" and write a short message
6. Wait for the project owner to accept or decline
7. Your dashboard shows all your applications and teams

### Project Owner (need teammates)

1. Connect wallet, create your profile first
2. Click "Create Project" and fill in what you're building
3. Upload a project logo (optional, but looks cool)
4. Say what you need: "Need 2 frontend devs, 1 smart contract dev"
5. Post it—now it's live and developers can find you
6. Check your inbox when collaboration requests come in
7. Accept the ones you like, decline the rest (both get a receipt)
8. Your dashboard shows who's on your team

### What you see

- **Dashboard**: your projects, applications, team members—all in one place
- **Browse**: find projects or developers by skills and tech stack
- **Inbox**: manage requests (who wants to join you, who accepted you)
- **Receipts**: every action has a public blockchain link you can verify

## What you need

A **Phantom wallet** on your phone or browser. That's it.

(We're on Solana testnet for now—means it's free to try!)

**No sign-ups**. No emails. No passwords. Your wallet is your login.

## Key features

**Create your profile**: add your skills, bio, GitHub, Twitter, tech stack

**Upload images**: profile pics and project logos stored on IPFS forever

**Post projects**: say what you're building and what help you need

**Find teammates**: browse developers by skills (React, Rust, Solana, etc.)

**Send requests**: one-click to apply to join a project

**Accept/decline**: project owners can review and respond to requests

**Dashboard**: track your projects, applications, and active teams

**Receipts**: every action has a public blockchain link you can check

**Dark mode**: looks good day or night

**Fast**: pages load instantly (even with blockchain in the background)

## Why it matters

### For you

**No more ghosting**: every request and response is recorded—you can see what happened.

**Build your rep**: your profile lives forever. Future teams can see what you've worked on.

**One wallet, many apps**: your c0Foundr profile could work with other Web3 tools later.

### For project owners

**Find real builders**: people apply with their actual on-chain profiles, not fake LinkedIn accounts.

**Clear records**: you can prove who's on your team and when they joined.

**Fair collaboration**: everyone sees the same info—no hidden changes or deleted messages.

### For everyone

**No platform lock-in**: your data isn't trapped. If c0Foundr shuts down, you still own everything.

**Open and fair**: anyone can verify claims. No company decides who's "credible."

## Safety and privacy

We don't ask for your real name or email. Your wallet address is enough.

If you switch laptops or phones, just restore your wallet—everything comes back.

Every action you take has a public link (like a receipt) you can check anytime.

Your photos live on IPFS, not our server—they'll never disappear.

## Common questions (quick)

**Do I need crypto experience?**  
No. Treat your wallet like a login button. That's all you need to know.

**Can someone fake my profile?**  
Nope. Your wallet is your identity. Only you can sign actions from it.

**What if I lose my phone?**  
Restore your wallet with your seed phrase. Your profile/projects are still there.

**Is this only for Solana devs?**  
Not at all! We support ALL tech stacks: React, Rust, Python, anything.

**What if c0Foundr shuts down?**  
Your data lives on the blockchain, not our servers. You keep everything.

## Problem this solves

LinkedIn owns your profile. Discord servers get deleted. GitHub doesn't help you find teammates.

Developers can't prove who they've worked with. "I was on this project" is just a claim—no receipts.

Web3 needs Web3-native tools—not platforms that can lock you out or sell your data.

c0Foundr puts collaboration on the blockchain: you own your profile, projects are public, and partnerships are verifiable forever.
